NOTE!
You need to update your database now becuase I switched it over to the database we will be using. Also it directs you to the login page first. In order for the application to work correctly you will need to go to clinic.com/index.php or localhost/index.php


Here is the mysql query to add a new user "insert into users (busID,username, password) values (2,'users', MD5('password'));"




You need to use the finaldb.sql file to load the database.
You can do this by running 'mysql -u root -p business < finaldb.sql
